# machine-learning-for-economics-and-finance-in-tensorflow2

This file is for the book *Machine Learning for Economics and Finance in TensorFlow 2*.

Even though there is data and codes repository in github, I don't want to rely on them. 

I write codes and take notes in jupyter notebook for only my own study and my future reference. It would be better to click 'star' if this file can help you.
